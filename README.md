My name is Lynn. I am a trained ICT specialist. I am currently one of the 16 people to most recently join the Powercoders family. We are the 2nd class of 2020. We are currently in preparation for the 3 months Bootcamp beginning in September. I am looking so forward. I am a strong believer in: <b>If can think it you can have it</b> and <b>Everything is just a thought and a thought can be changed</b>. So, I always try to remember that what I think, creates my reality. Therefore I actively change every negative thought into a positive thought. <P>Enough about me. Now let's write some chord</P>.
