Today I finally dove in and created my first web page on Github. I started by creating my first Repository.Then I learnt how to create files and directories. 
I created my first page with html. The result was as follows.
<p><img src="/images/html.jpg"></p>
Then I was able to create a CSS file to format the content in my html code so as to make my site look more appealing as seen below.
<p><img src="/images/withcss.png"></p>
