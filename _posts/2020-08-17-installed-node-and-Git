title: Intalled Git, Node.js and Browser-sync
---
I installed Gid, Node.js and Browser-Sync on my computer. I learnt that one of the uses of Browser-sync is to enable the developer see the result of changes to code in rea time.
I learnec about branches and the role they play in ensuring that only code that has been carefully reviewed and tested can be put in the Master branch
