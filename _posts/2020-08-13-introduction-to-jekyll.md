title: Introduction to Jekyll
---


I was introduced to the site generator Jenkyll and how to use it to make working with my site easeir and faster by creating layouts that I can call in the content I create so that I do not have to repeat code unnecessarilly. For example, a website will generally have the same footer and header. So code for these can be saved in a seperate file and called whenever this layout is needed. 
<p>I have created two layouts so far: One default.html for the layout of the general site and post.html for the layout of my daily posts in the blog.</p>

I also learnt a bit about .yml files which are files that tell Jekyll some basic information about the site like the title, version of markdown used and permalinks.

I learned how to create posts and set up a blog so that all my posts can be autamatically displayed as they are created.
