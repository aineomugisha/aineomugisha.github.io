I informed myself about Github amd Github pages in order to understand what it is, the idea behind it and how it works. I was fascinated by this whole world of a collaborative progaming community I wasn't aware of before we got the assignment. Most impressive apart from the fact that one has access to the largest source of alreadr written code and an opportunity to learn from the best minds in the game for free, is the fact that even someone who has never written code can use it easily. Of course I barely scratched the surface and there is a lot to be learned. I am looking forward to getting my feet wet and soaking up as much as is humanly possible.
