<h3>"By believing you can do something, you are already halfway there." Theodore Roosevelt 1910 &copy;</h3>
<p>Today I continued to attend the lecture about HTML. This time the lecture covered how to create links and set targets for those links using the tag <b>&lt;a&gt;</b>. A target determines where the link will open. Same page or new tab or Page.</p>

<p>What stood out for me was that the attributes of this tag can be set so they link to a specific section of the same page by using fragment identifiers like id. This is especially helpful for writing single page applications and it also makes it possible to send someone a link to a specific part of a web page. Which usually saves the users time.</p>

<p>Next we learnt about displaying images and the importance of writing alternative text as one of the attributes and setting size parameters of said images as this will always make sure that the structure of the page stays undisturbed in case the image is missing. It also helps to load the image faster in case the user of the page has slow internet. </p>
