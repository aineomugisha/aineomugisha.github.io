CSS refers to cascading style sheets. CSS applies a set of rules to HTML elements in order to govern how they are displayed in a web page or a browser. The beauty with CSS is it helps one avoid repeating the same code for every element in html and in turn makes writing code for any size of website faster and less tiring. A set of CSS rules is referred to as a style sheet.

    <p><b>P</b> is an example of a selector. A selector is usually an element used within a Tag in an html document. Other selectors include img, a, classes and Ids etc.</p><p>Inside the parenthesis you find a <b>declaration </b> which consists of <b>a property</b> and the <b>value of the property</b>. Examples of a property value are color, width etc.</p>
  
   
<h2>Element, Class, ID selectors</h2>
As element is something that is used in an html tag to design the structure of a section or part of an html document. These include a, h, p, header etc.. where as a class and an ID are usually attibutes of elements. 
The images below show the syntax of working with these selectors

  
    <img src = "/images/elementselector.png"> <img src = "/images/classselector.png">
    
     
      <img src = "/images/idselector.png"> <img src = "/images/selectors.png">

<h2>Combined Selectors</h2>
Combing selectors can be time saving in that it heps one avoid repeating of chord in case more than one html component have the same formationg. For example if all H1 headings and all paragraphs have the same color this can be specified in the same CSS rule. 
There are a number of ways of combining selectors namely: combining elements with class selectors, using child selectors, (done by using the greater than sign), and descendant Selectors(Using a space), or grouping Selctors (seperating the selctors with commas). Elements can be combined with classes or ids. A combined selector is always read from right to left. 
Here is all this information in pictures:
