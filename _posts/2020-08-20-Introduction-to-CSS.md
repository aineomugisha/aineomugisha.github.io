CSS refers to cascading style sheets. CSS applies a set of rules to HTML elements in order to govern how they are displayed in a web page or a browser. The beauty with CSS is it helps one avoid repeating the same code for every element in html and in turn makes writing code for any size of website faster and less tiring. A set of CSS rules is referred to as a style sheet.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/cssruleanatomy.png"></td>

Other selectors include img, a, classes etc.<p>Inside the parenthesis you find a <b>declaration </b> which consists of <b>a property</b> and the <b>value of the property</b>. Examples of a property value are color, width etc.</p></td>
  </tr>
