title: Intalled Git, Node.js and Browser-sync
---
I installed Gid, Node.js and Browser-Sync on my computer. I learnt that one of the uses of Browser-sync is to enable the developer see the result of changes to code in rea time.
I learnec about branches: The Master and the other branches and the role they play in ensuring that only code that has been carefully reviewed and tested can be put in the Master branch. I learned about push and pull requests which are used to access and grant access to code to and from the other members of the team working on the same project. I also learned some commands in terminal/Command Prompt for working with Git.
