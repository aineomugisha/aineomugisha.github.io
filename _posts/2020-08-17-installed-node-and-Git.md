title: Installed Git, Node.js and Browser-sync
---
I installed Gid, Node.js and Browser-Sync on my computer. I learnt that one of the uses of Browser-sync is to enable the developer see the result of changes to code in rea time.
I learnec about branches: The Master and the other branches and the role they play in ensuring that only code that has been carefully reviewed and tested can be put in the Master branch. I learned about push and pull requests which are used to access and grant access to code to and from the other members of the team working on the same project. I also learned some commands in terminal/Command Prompt for working with Git.

I also read some frequently asked questions and git about how to ask questions in a way that doesn't waste time of people who are trying to help you for example by being specific about your as clearly and as precisely as possible. I also learn about important resources like jsfiddle.net and codepen.io that will help me to publish my code so that it is easy for others to help me identify errors or to help answer my questions better.
