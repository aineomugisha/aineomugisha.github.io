title: Refresher look at HTML

<h3><p><b>Note: HTML is to Structure as CSS is to Style and as Java script is to behavior.</b></p></h3> 
Today I learnt more about HTML. I learnt about document type declaration ie, <!doctype html>, about the basic structure of an HTML document,

 I learnt about different html tags, tag attributes, semantic elements like headings and sections that help both the user and the computer make sense of the html code.

I also learnt about <b>block-level elements and inline elements</b>. Block level elements like <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> require their own space which means they always display on the next line and any other elements that come after must also start on a new line. Inline elements mean that whatever is in them will display in the same line.

I was reminded about lists more so ordered lists<b>&lt;ol&gt;</b>(bulleted), unordered lists <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;li&gt;</b> for list item. 

<p>The newest thing I learnt today is how to tell html to print characters that would normally be recognised as part of the html syntax for example &lt; by writing &lt followed by a semicolon and or characters that do not usually exist on a keyboard like the copyright sign &copy; by writing &copy followed by a semicolon. </p>
