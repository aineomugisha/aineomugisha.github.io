The final version of the app.js file looks like that, in this file we have the two methods for conversion and the event listeners.
First, we get the arabicInput and the romanInput, and for both of them, we are listening for the input action. For arabicInput every time, a number is entered the arabicToRoman method is called and puts its value into the romanInput.value. On the other hand for the romanInput, every time a roman numeral is entered it calls the romanToArabic method and puts its value into the arabicInput.value.
