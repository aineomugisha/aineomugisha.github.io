	<h1>Hi, it's Lynn. WELCOME!</h1>
	<p> I have great news! I finally made it into Powercoders. I am so excited. Very soon the bootcamp will start. So, I decided: Since we have been together from the very beginning, it is only right that I share my progress with you and hopefully I will inspire you to apply next year. </p> 
	<P>You can find everything on <a href="/blog/index.html"> my blog </a>
