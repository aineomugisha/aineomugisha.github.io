If doing CSS from scratch rem is a better font size format 
Problem with vh, vw, they become too small on small screen same as on huge screens. Font can become very big

Way around this
- use maximum font size and minimum font size

for dektop querry selector use, px value to make sure it is not getting to big
and on small screeen too px

For rem state the font size in html because that is the base

Use pt for letter spacing. It is a lot cleaner
Pt is used for printing

Default font in * 1.6em

Also start with HTML, CSS and then JS
always use add eventListener

Using var ensures that the the variable is accessible in the whole funtion. 
Var creates global variables 
Variables created using var are attached the window object 
For example var color ="red" can be accessed by window.color

Avoid adding stuff to the window object: It makes it easy for them to be replaced by 3rd party code
